My name is Courtney

I am making a career change from KYC/AML (Anti-Money Laundering) to progeamming. I will be graduating in November with my BA in Software Development at the ager of 43. I am extremely exictied to start this new journey. I have always had a love and passion for technology since I was a kid. Now I am grown with a family of my own and I want to let my kids know, you are never too old to accomplish goals you set for yourself.
